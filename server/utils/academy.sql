This course was just completely overhauled to prepare students for the 2022 job market, with over 60 hours of brand new content. This is the only course you need to learn web development. There are a lot of options for online developer training, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market. Here\'s why: This is the only Udemy course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor with a track record of success. 94% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs. Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them. The previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost $14,000 and $21,000.</p>\r\n<p>This course is just as comprehensive but with brand new content for a fraction of the price. Everything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to 2022\'s developer job market. This course does not cut any corners. I just spent 8 months redoing this behemoth of a course! We build 13+ projects, including a gigantic production application called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application. The course is constantly updated with new content, projects, and modules. Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training. You get to meet my cats and chickens! When you\'re learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the \"beginner friendly\" classes. With this course, you get the best of both worlds.</p>\r\n<p>This is a course designed for the complete beginner, yet it covers some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry. Throughout the brand new version of the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including: HTML5 CSS3 Flexbox Responsive Design JavaScript (all 2022 modern syntax, ES6, ES2018, etc.) Asynchronous JavaScript - Promises, async/await, etc. AJAX and single page apps Bootstrap 4 and 5 (alpha) SemanticUI Bulma CSS Framework DOM Manipulation Unix(Command Line) Commands NodeJS NPM ExpressJS Templating REST SQL vs. NoSQL databases MongoDB Database Associations Schema Design Mongoose Authentication From Scratch Cookies &amp; Sessions Authorization Common Security Issues - SQL Injection, XSS, etc. Developer Best Practices Deploying Apps Cloud Databases Image Upload and Storage Maps and Geocoding This course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented.</p>\r\n<p>Many online courses are just a long series of \"watch as I code\" videos. This course is different. I\'ve incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes: Lectures Code-Alongs Projects Exercises Research Assignments Slides Downloads Readings Too many pictures of my dog Rusty If you have any questions, please don\'t hesitate to contact me. I got into this industry because I love working with people and helping students learn.

It\'s creative.\r\n\r\nIt gives you a huge self-satisfaction when you look at your work and say, \"I made this!\". I love that feeling after I\'m done working on something. When I lean back in my chair, look at the final result with a smile, and have this little \"spark joy\" moment.\r\n\r\nIt\'s especially satisfying when I know I just made $5,000.\r\n\r\nWouldn\'t you want to have that?\r\nThere are many ways one can achieve this lifestyle. This is my way. This is how I achieved a lifestyle I\'ve been fantasizing about for five years. And I\'m going to teach you the same.\r\n\r\nOften people think Web Design is complicated. That it needs some creative talent or knack for computers. Sure, a lot of people make it very complicated. People make the simplest things complicated. Like most subjects taught in the universities.\r\n\r\nBut I don\'t like complicated. I like easy. I like life hacks. I like to take the shortest and simplest route to my destination. I haven\'t gone to an art school or have a computer science degree. I\'m an outsider to this field who hacked himself into it, somehow ending up being a sought-after professional.\r\n\r\nThat\'s how I\'m going to teach you Web Design. So you\'re not demotivated on your way with needless complexity. So you enjoy the process because it\'s simple and fun. So you can become a Freelance Web Designer in no time.\r\n\r\nFor example, this is a Design course but I don\'t teach you Photoshop. Because Photoshop is needlessly complicated for Web Design. But people still teach it to web designers. I don\'t. I teach Figma – a simple tool that is taking over the design world. You will be designing a complete website within a week while others are still learning how to create basic layouts in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nSecond, this is a Development course. But I don\'t teach you how to code. Because for Web Design coding is needlessly complicated and takes too long to learn. Instead, I teach Webflow – a tool that is taking over the web design world. You will be building complex websites within two weeks while others are still learning the basics of HTML & CSS.\r\n\r\nThird, this is a Freelancing course. But I don\'t just teach you how to write great proposals. I give you a winning proposal template.

All you need is the passion to learn and an inquisitive, experimental nature for combining code, animation, graphics, artificial intelligence, art and audio.  Sounds like a lot?  It is, but when you see how you as a solo developer can bring it all together there\'s a touch of magic in the air.\r\n\r\nUnity is the number one game development engine due to its ease of use and yet powerful abilities.  It works on all platforms and can export to desktop, console and mobile devices.  It\'s a great way for the beginner to jump straight into the world of game development and get their hands on the tools used by AAA game studios to produce games such as Hearthstone (Blizzard Entertainment), Cities: Skylines (Colossal Order) and Monument Valley 2 (ustwo Games) and best of all, for the beginner and hobbyist it is free!\r\n\r\nIn this course, Penny demystifies Unity\'s interface and plethora of tools to bring art, code, design, and more together to produce a fully-fledged First Person Shooter game completely from scratch. Using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and knowledge from over 25 years working with games, graphics, and having written two award-winning books on games A.I., Penny will take you from complete noob to a confident user of Unity. Throughout, you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to take you through every step of becoming familiar with all the functionality of the game engine.  Throughout, you will work towards the creation of a First Person Shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world complete with zombies out for the player\'s brains!\r\n\r\nThis course was created with Unity 2019.3.11f however is compatible with Unity 2019.4.2f1 (LTS) on either Mac or PC.\r\n\r\nContents and Overview\r\n\r\nThe course begins with a section to introduce you to the Unity interface.  If you are already familiar with Unity, you can skip to Section 3.  In this introductory session, we will cover Unity\'s window system, how to add models and textures, the creation of code to manipulate the properties of models, and the physics system.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, we will start work on the First Person Character (FPC).  You will learn how to add physics and code to move the character around, as well as add animated arms and a weapon that you can see in the game view.  You will also work to add animations for firing and reloading the weapon.  Audio effects for the player\'s footsteps and jumping will also be included here.\r\n\r\nNext, you will create pickup items for medical kits and ammunition that can be scattered around the game environment to provide extra resources to the player when their health or bullet levels get low.  Here you will learn about how colliders and triggers can be used to fire off code to update values on the player that store an inventory.\r\n\r\nWe will then jump into the Unity Terrain Sculpting tool and work through the creation of a large game map on which to place the FPC and enemies.  You will work with textures to colour the terrain and models, to add extra details such as trees and grass.  High-quality models of houses, rocks, fences, and other props will be included for you to be as creative as you like in developing the game environment.\r\n\r\nBy this point, you\'ll be ready to start adding the zombies.  You will first begin with the zombie models and learn how to add animations to them and then move them about on the game environment using navigation meshes.  Then we will cover one of the most popular artificial intelligence techniques used in games for creating simple behaviours in non-player characters; the Finite State Machine.  You will develop enemies capable of wandering, chasing, attacking, dying, and standing idle.  These actions will be linked to the location of the player such that the zombies will ignore the player when they are far away and only attack when in range.\r\n\r\nOnce these mechanics are in place, you will learn how to use raycasts to link the player\'s shooting animations with a hit to the zombie.  When hit, the zombie death animation will play and you will also be able to add in a ragdoll instead at this point.  We will work with spotlights to create a crosshair aiming system and program dead zombies to sink into the ground, to remove them from the game.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, we tie everything together with a Heads Up Display complete with health meter, an ammunition count, a radar for detecting nearby zombies, and a compass to point the player toward their goal location.\r\n\r\nOnce you have put all the game mechanics in place, you\'ll learn several techniques for taking your game to a more professional level with special effects, extra audio & feedback, and a main menu switching system.\r\n\r\nThis is the perfect course to get started with Unity if you are an absolute beginner or learn a few extra techniques if you are familiar with the engine.
